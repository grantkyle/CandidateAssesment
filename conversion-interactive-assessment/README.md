# Hummer Landing Page

This is a landing page for a trucking business, built with the React library for a few main reasons, but mainly because it is scalable, responsive and fast and, perhaps most importantly, it is surrounded by a huge (and growing) ecosystem, making the application's potential limitless. 

The only dependencies I used were react-bootstrap (a killer library for reusable components), and the font-awesome npm.
